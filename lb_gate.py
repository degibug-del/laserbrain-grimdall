"""lb_gate.py — a PreToolUse gate that makes coverage structural instead of optional.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Nudging does not work, and there is now two days of evidence. The
PostToolUse hook counts steps, captures the ground goal, logs failed commands and prints
a reminder every eight steps. Coverage on 2026-07-24 was 10%. On 2026-07-25, with the
nudge firing and a whole protocol written about it, coverage was 6% — it went DOWN.

An advisory that is ignored is not a control. dogfood.py withholds any detection result
below 50%, calibrate.py refuses to derive a profile, and precision has never once been
computed. All of it waits on a number that discipline has failed to move twice.

So this blocks. After BLOCK_AFTER steps without a spelled check, no tool runs until
check_state is called. Coverage stops being a virtue and becomes a precondition.

TWO THINGS IT MUST NEVER DO:

  deadlock — the laserbrain tools are ALWAYS allowed. Blocking check_state while
             demanding check_state is a trap, and it would be the only bug here that
             could not be worked around.

  break    — any exception, any malformed input, any missing session: allow. A gate that
             fails closed takes the session down with it. Every path exits 0 and the
             default is to permit.

Host notes (2026-07-25, from wiring a second host):
  - WRITE_TOOLS must include search_replace: it is a primary edit tool on some hosts.
  - LASERBRAIN_AGENT is often missing on the hook process (MCP sets it, hooks do not);
    fall back to the session file's agent so a host does not self-block on its own claims.
  - link entries use agent= or from= — accept both.
  - search_tool is always allowed so a blocked agent can re-discover laserbrain schemas
    without burning the gate (discovery is read-only).
  - Deny text is agent-aware: hosts differ in how a tool is invoked (see CHECK_HOWTO).

# discipline produced, and it does NOT clear the 50% dogfood.py needs — only 1 does, and
# a check between every single tool call is a tax nobody would keep paying. 20% is the
# honest trade: the corpus stays attributable and dense enough to be worth reading, and

# around 20-25%. Tonight's sessions ran 21-29%, so the trade is holding.
#
# What was NOT decided is that the two thresholds live in different files with nothing
# joining them. dogfood.py had MIN_COVERAGE = 0.5 hard-coded and this hook had a step
# count, so no one editing either could see the other, and a run could satisfy the gate
# while being unscoreable — which is every run we have.
#
# So the floor is named once, here, and read from the environment. A benchmark sets it to
# the scorer's floor and pays the tax deliberately for the length of the study:
#
#     LASERBRAIN_MIN_COVERAGE=0.5 <run the benchmark>
#
# and dogfood.py reads the same variable, so the number the gate enforces and the number
# the scorer demands cannot disagree by accident again. They can still be set low on
