"""lb_coverage.py — PostToolUse / UserPromptSubmit / Stop hook for laserbrain coverage.

Makes coverage automatic instead of remembered. Works for Claude Code (snake_case)
and Grok Build (camelCase). Same session directory: ~/.claude/laserbrain.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-07-24 a long, error-dense session produced ten independently
caught errors and ONE laserbrain check across ~48 steps — 2% coverage. The agent
had a standing order to call check_state each step and did not. That is not a
discipline problem to be solved by more discipline: "remember to call it every step"
is not an interface.

WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DO. A hook is a shell command; it cannot spell the agent's
goal, progress or distance, so it cannot call check_state on the agent's behalf.
What it can do is:

  1. COUNT the steps (dogfood denominator).
  2. LOG catches it can see (non-zero shell exits).
  3. INTERRUPT when coverage lapses:
       - Claude: PostToolUse additionalContext
       - Grok: Stop gate with decision=block (PostToolUse stdout is ignored)

SAFETY. Every path is wrapped; exits 0 unconditionally except intentional stop-blocks.
A hook that crashes the tool it observes is worse than no hook.

    NO CALLER: the evidence channel existed and nothing fed it, so every run reported
    0.5 forever. A number that cannot move is not a measurement.

    This is the feed. The hook is the only thing that sees every tool call and whether it

    A MONOTONIC COUNTER, not a flag. A flag would need the reader to reset it, and a reader

    remembers the count it last saw: if `ok` has advanced since then, something succeeded
    in the interval, and that is exactly the question. Nobody has to clear anything.
